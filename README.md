# Product-TaskingPlatform
Hybrid Mock-Up | Edge + Ground Processing Model – A conceptual prototype showcasing a hybrid solution that combines on-board (edge) and ground-based processing to deliver medium-latency insights. Users can set urgency, AOI, and frequency to choose between ultra-fast (on-board) or cost-efficient (on-ground) options

Overview
This mock-up represents the idea of designing a hybrid product offering for customers who require medium-latency insights — a balance between real-time speed and cost efficiency.

Concept
The interface allows users to define:
1. Area of Interest (AOI) and Task Frequency
2. Urgency of the task using an Urgency Indicator

Based on these inputs, the system intelligently recommends the best-fit processing route:
A. On-Board (Ultra-Fast) – For time-critical insights using edge processing
B. On-Ground (Standard) – For routine or cost-sensitive use cases

This concept bridges the gap between full real-time analytics and delayed batch processing, offering flexibility tailored to user needs.

## Key Features

- Interactive demo guiding customers through urgency and AOI selection
- Smart recommendations based on business-case priorities
- Visualizes how hybrid delivery optimizes both speed and cost

Goal
To illustrate how hybrid architecture (Edge + Cloud) can optimize both response time and operational cost, empowering customers to define their own balance between speed and efficiency.
